Case Studies Project
This repository contains the necessary files to run a custom WordPress project, which includes a dedicated API for case studies and custom Gutenberg blocks to display them.

The project is divided into two main components:

Case Study API: Handles the backend logic and data retrieval for the case studies.

Case Study Blocks: Provides the front-end blocks for the Gutenberg editor, allowing users to display the case studies on the website.

Folder Structure
The repository is structured with two key directories to keep the API and the blocks separated.

case-studies-api: Contains all the code related to the custom API.

case-study-blocks: Contains the front-end blocks and their dependencies.

Getting Started
To use this project, you'll need to install and configure both the API and the blocks within your WordPress environment.

Clone the repository: Clone this repository to your local machine.

Install the API: Place the case-studies-api folder in your wp-content/plugins/ directory and activate the plugin in your WordPress dashboard.

Install the Blocks: Place the case-study-blocks folder in your wp-content/plugins/ directory and activate the plugin.

Once both are installed, your custom case study content should be available through the API and accessible via the Gutenberg editor.
